## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The goal of the project is to implement a branch-and-bound algorithm for solving a task scheduling problem with a machine. 
It is possible to describe a branch-and-bound algorithm using mixed integer linear programming: MIP. 
Once the MIP is described, the solver will execute a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve it. 
We are given a method to build a branch-and-bound, this method is based on the Schrage algorithm.

The goal of this project is to realize optimized versions for MIP and branch-and-bound. 
Then we will propose an efficient and exhaustive visualization with Plotly. Then in a second time, to compare the performances of the two methods.
